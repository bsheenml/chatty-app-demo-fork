### React + Firebase - Real-Time Chat App

This project forks the source code of [https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-real-time-chat-app-with-react-and-firebase/) and configures with my Firebase Services.

See Demo: [https://chatty-app-demo.firebaseapp.com/](https://auth-firebase-tailwind.firebaseapp.com/)

## Motivation

Originally attempted to recreate from blank Create React App.
Returned errors. Bootstrapping to debug my codebase.
